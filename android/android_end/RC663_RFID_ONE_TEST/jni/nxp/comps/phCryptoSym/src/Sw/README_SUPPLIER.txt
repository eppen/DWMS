DEAR SUPPLIER!
================
This is your working directory for the small footprint cryptographic library.
The two files 
	phCrypto_Sw.c
	phCrypto_Sw.h 
	
	are already created for you and must not be changed in their name as these are the
	interface files.
	In order to keep your software modular you will want to have more source files.
	You are allowed to create as many .c files within this folder as you need.
	The filename has to start with ph e.g. phKeyloading.c
	If you need your own header file for your internal modules please call it phCrypto_Sw_Int.h
